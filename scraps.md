## Methods

#### Complete checklists introduction

Complete checklists allow to infer non-detection of a species in locations
where sampling events occurred, but the species was not recorded.

Complete checklists allow to infer non-detection of a species in locations
where sampling events occurred and other species were detected.

Complete checklists offers information on where sampling events occurred, but
a species was not recorded. Using them instead of regular checklists offers
large performance gains in species distribution models [@Johnston2019BesPra].

#### Complete checklists to presence-absence format

Given that we used complete checklists only, the absence of a species in a
site means that it was not detected, and discards the possibility that it was
simply not recorded by the user. 

The absence of a species in a complete checklist _is_ a non-detection event,
not an omission of record by the user.

#### BARTS

BARTs have a bayesian formulation: they iteratively generate sets of trees based
on a priors about tree structure and nodes, then build a posterior distribuion
of predicted classification probabilities [@Carlson2020EmbSpe]. 

BARTs are a bayesian sum-of-trees model where trees are constrained by priors
and inclusing an iterative Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm
[@Chipman2010BarBay]. 

## Results

## Distribution results

The species distribution models generated richness and uniqueness results that
matched those from observed data, comforting their potential to fill-in gaps in
poorly sampled regions. 

The species distribution models generated relevant community predictions in
terms of richness and uniqueness, which match the results from the
observed data.

At a broad and coarse scale, this should be similar to the distributions from
IUCN.
