# Abstract 

(copy-paste from metadata, I just like having it here too)

Beta diversity is an essential measure to describe the organization of
biodiversity in space. The calculation of local contributions to beta diversity
(LCBD), specifically, allows for the identification of sites with exceptional
diversity within a region of interest. To this day, LCBD indices have mostly
been used on regional and smaller scales, with relatively few sites.
Furthermore, as beta diversity implies a comparison among the sites of a given
region, their use is typically restricted to strictly sampled sites with known
species composition, hence to discontinuous spatial scales. Here, we investigate
the variation of LCBD indices on extended spatial scales including both
species-poor and species-rich regions, and investigate their applicability for
continuous scales and unsampled sites through the use of species distribution
models (SDMs). To this aim, we used Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs)
to model species composition on continuous scales based on observation data from
the eBird database. Our results highlight a changing relationship between site
richness and LCBD values for species-poor and species-rich regions depending on
the extent of the full region of interest. We also show that SDMs return
relevant LCBD predictions displaying the same relationship as the one obtained
with observation data only. Hence, our method could prove useful to identify
beta diversity hotspots in unsampled locations, which could be important targets
for conservation purposes.

# Introduction

Beta diversity, defined as the variation in species composition among sites in a
geographic region of interest [@Legendre2005AnaBet], is an essential measure
to describe the organization of biodiversity in space. Total beta diversity
within a community can be partitioned into local contributions to beta diversity
(LCBD) [@Legendre2013BetDiv], which allows for the identification of
sites with exceptional species composition, hence exceptional biodiversity. Such
a method, focusing on specific sites, is useful for both community ecology and
conservation biology, as it highlights areas that are most important for their
research or conservation values. However, the use of LCBD indices is currently
limited in two ways. First, LBCD indices are typically used on local or regional
scales with relatively few sites, for example on fish communities at intervals
along a river stream [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. Second, LCBD calculation
methods require complete information on community composition, such as a
community composition matrix $Y$, thus they are inappropriate for partially
sampled sites, let alone for unsampled ones. Accordingly, the method is of
limited use to identify areas with exceptional biodiversity in regions with poor
and sparse sampling. However, predictive approaches are increasingly common
given recent development of computational methods, which often generate novel
ecological insights from existing data [@Poisot2019DatSyn] including for
unsampled or lesser-known locations, as well as larger spatial scales. Here, we
examine whether the LCBD method can be used to assess ecological uniqueness on
broad and continuous scales based on predictions of species distributions,
and evaluate whether this brings novel ecological insights regarding the
identification of exceptional biodiversity areas.

Species distribution models (SDMs) [@Guisan2005PreSpe] can bring a new
perspective to LCBD studies by allowing to fill-in gaps and perform analyses on
much broader scales.  In a community matrix $Y$, such as required for LCBD
calculation, ecological communities are abstracted as assemblages of species
present at different sites. Viewing communities as such opens the perspective of
predicting community composition from predictions of individual species, which
is precisely the aim of SDMs. Community-level modelling from SDMs is not an
especially novel idea [@Ferrier2002ExtSta; @Ferrier2006SpaMod], but it is
increasingly relevant with the advent of large-scale, massive, and open data
sources on species occurrences, often contributed by citizens, such as eBird and
GBIF. At their core, SDMs aim to predict the distribution of a species based on
information about where the species was previously reported, matched with
environmental data at those locations, and then make predictions at other
(unsampled) locations based on their respective environmental conditions. Going
from single-species SDMs to a whole community is not a trivial task -- many
alternatives have been suggested, such as stacked species distribution models
(S-SDMs) [@Ferrier2006SpaMod], spatially explicit species assemblage modelling
(SESAM) [@Guisan2011SesNew], joint species distribution models (JSDMs)
[@Pollock2014UndCoo], and hierarchical modeling of species communities (HMSC)
[@Ovaskainen2017HowMak]. These alternative methods have all have different
strengths, but even S-SDMs, in a sense the most simple and less
community-specific method, have been shown to provide reliable community
predictions [@Norberg2019ComEva; @Zurell2020TesSpe]. This is important, as in
the context of large scale studies with a high number of sites and species, such
as required for uniqueness analysis on broad continuous scales, reducing the
model complexity with a simpler, yet efficient model as an S-SDM can be critical
in terms of required computations. Regardless of the method used,
community-level analyses can be applied on the resulting community prediction
[@Ferrier2006SpaMod], something which has been lacking for measures other than
species richness [@Ferrier2006SpaMod], and notably to the LCBD framework, which
knowledge has never been applied on SDM results. 

However, applying local contributions to beta diversity on SDM predictions
raises the issue of calculating the uniqueness scores on much larger community
matrices. The total number of sites will increase because of (i) the continuous
scale of the predictions, as there will be more sites in the region of interest
now that it is not restricted to sampled ones, and (ii)  because of the larger
spatial extent allowed by SDM predictions. A high number of sites as well as a
large extent opens up the possibility of capturing a lot of variability of
habitatsÂ­ and community composition, but also a great number of very similar
ones, which could possibly change the way that exceptional sites contribute to
the overall variance in the large-scale community. LCBD scores have normally
been used on local or regional scales with relatively few sites
[@Legendre2013BetDiv; @daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017UnrCor; @Heino2017ExpSpe].
Some studies did use the measure over broader, near continental extents
[@Yang2015ComSim; @Poisot2017HosPar; @Taranu2020LarMul], but the total number of
sites in these studies was relatively low. Recent studies also investigated LCBD
and beta diversity on sites distributed in grids or as pixels of environmental
raster layers, hence continuous scales, but these did not cover large extents
and a high number of sites [@Tan2017HowBet; @Tan2019UndPro;
@DAntraccoli2020MorSpe]. @Niskanen2017DriHig predicted LCBD values of plant
communities (and 3 other diversity measures) on a continuous scale and a high
number of sites (> 25 000) using Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs); however, they
modelled the diversity measures directly, instead of measuring them after
modelling species distributions first as we suggest here, and obtained lower
predictive accuracy for LCBD than for the other measures, highlighting the
challenge of predicting this measure . They also used a finer resolution (1 km x
1 km) on a regional scale, not a continental one. Therefore, the distribution of
LCBD values on broad, continuous scales with a high number of sites and
predicted species assemblages remains to be investigated.

Measuring ecological uniqueness from LCBD indices on extended continuous scales
also raises the question of which sites will be identified as exceptional, and
for what reason. The intent of the method is that sites should stand out and
receive a high LCBD score whenever they display an exceptional community
composition, be it a unique assemblage of species, or a richer or poorer
community than most in the region [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. However, both the
original study and later empirical ones have shown a decreasing relationship
between LCBD scores and species richness [@Legendre2013BetDiv;
@daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017UnrCor; @Heino2017ExpSpe]. In other words, the
method tends to identify the poorest sites as the most exceptional ones.
However, this negative remains to be tested on broad continuous scales. Total
beta diversity increases with spatial extent [@Barton2013SpaSca] and is strongly
dependent on scale, notably because of en higher environmental heterogeneity and
sampling of different local species pool [@Heino2015ComAna], which could
potentially add some variation to the relationship.

This study shows that species distribution modelling offers relevant LCBD and
community-level predictions on broad spatial scales, similar to the ones
obtained from occurrence data, hereby providing uniqueness assessments in poorly
sampled regions. Our results further highlight a changing relationship between
site richness and LCBD values depending on (i) the regions on which it is used,
as species poor and species rich sites display different uniqueness profiles;
and on (ii) the scale at which it is applied, as increasing the spatial extent
can merge the uniqueness profiles of contrasting subregions to create a new,
distinct one at a broader scale. Hence, our method could prove useful to
identify beta diversity hotspots in unsampled locations on large spatial scales,
which could be important targets for conservation purposes.

# Methods

We measured how compositional uniqueness varies on extended continuous scales.
We first predicted species composition on continuous scales using extended
occurrence data from eBird and species distribution models. We then quantified
compositional uniqueness for both predicted and observed data, and compared the
relationship between uniqueness and richness for different regions and scales.
We used _Julia v1.5.3_ [@Bezanson2017JulFre] for most of the project, as well as
_R v4.0.2_ [@RCoreTeam2020RLan] for some specific steps. All the scripts used
for the analyses are available at
<https://github.com/gabrieldansereau/betadiversity-hotspots>.

## Occurrence data

We used occurrence data from eBird [@Sullivan2009EbiCit] downloaded through the
eBird Basic Dataset from June 2019 [@eBirdBasicDataset2019VerEbd]. We restricted
our analyses to the Warblers family (_Parulidae_) in North America (Canada,
United States, Mexico) using the _R_ package `auk` [@Strimas-Mackey2018AukEbi].
eBird is a semi-structured citizen science data set, meaning that observations
are reported as checklists of species detected in an observation run
[@Johnston2020AnaGui]. Observers can explicitly specify that their checklist
contains all species they could detect and identify during a sampling event, in
which case it is labelled as a "complete checklist". Using complete checklists
instead of regular checklists allows inferring non-detections in locations where
detection efforts did occur, which offers large performance gains in species
distribution models [@Johnston2020AnaGui]. Therefore, we selected the data from
the complete checklists only. Our final data set comprised 62 Warblers species
and nearly 23 million observations from 9 million checklists. Warblers are a
diverse group with a sufficient number of species, are popular among birders
given their charismatic aspect, are distributed in diverse areas, and are
present relatively everywhere in North America.

We then converted the occurrence data to a presence-absence format compatible
with community analyses. We considered every pixel from our 10 arc-minutes
environmental layers as a site. We then verified, for each species, if there was
a single observation in every site. We recorded the outcome as a binary value:
present (1) if a species was ever recorded in a site, and absent (0) if it
was not. Complete checklists ensure that these are non-detections, rather than
the species not being reported; hence we considered them as absence data,
similar to @Johnston2020AnaGui.

## Environmental data

Our environmental data consisted of climatic data from WorldClim 2.1
[@Fick2017Wor2N] and land cover data from the Copernicus Global Land Service
[@Buchhorn2019CopGlo]. The WorldClim data consists of spatially interpolated
monthly climate data for global land areas. We downloaded the data at a
resolution of 10 arc-minutes (around 18 kmÂ² at the equator), the coarsest
resolution available, using the _Julia_ package `SimpleSDMLayers.jl`
[@Dansereau2021SimJl]. The coarse resolution should mitigate potential
imprecisions in the eBird data regarding the extent of the sampled areas in each
observation checklist. Moreover, some studies have argued that coarser
resolutions lead to less overestimation of species richness and are better to
identify bird biodiversity hotspots given the patchiness of observation data
[@Hurlbert2007SpeRic]. We used the standard _bioClim_ variables, which represent
annual trends, ranges, and extremes of temperature and precipitation, but
selected only 8 out of the 19 ones to avoid redundancy among them (bio1, bio2,
bio5, bio6, bio12, bio13, bio14, bio15). The Copernicus data is a set of
variables representing 10 land cover classes (e.g. crops, tree, urban area) and
measured as a percentage of land cover fraction. The data is only available at a
finer resolution of 100m, which we downloaded directly from the website. We
coarsened it to the same 10 arc-minutes resolution as the WorldClim data by
averaging the cover fraction values of the pixels with `GDAL`
[@GDAL/OGRcontributors2021GdaOgr]. We first selected the 10 land cover variables
but later removed two of them (moss and snow) from our predictive models as
their cover fraction was 0% on all sites with Warblers observations; hence they
did not provide any predictive value to our SDM models.

## Species distribution models

We predicted species distribution on continuous scales from our presence-absence
data using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BARTs) [@Chipman2010BarBay], a
classification and regression trees method recently suggested for species
distribution modelling [@Carlson2020EmbSpe]. BARTs are sum-of-trees models,
conceptually similar to Boosted Regression Trees and Random Forest, but
following a Bayesian paradigm: trees are constrained as weak learners by priors
regarding structure and nodes, then fitting and inference is done through an
iterative Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm generating a posterior
distribution of predicted classification probabilities [@Chipman2010BarBay;
@Carlson2020EmbSpe]. We used the package `embarcadero` [@Carlson2020EmbSpe] in
_R_ to perform the BART models. We performed BARTs separately for all species
and estimated the probability of occurrence for all the sites in our region of
interest. We then converted the results to a binary outcome according to the
threshold that maximized the True Skill Statistic (TSS) for each species, as
suggested by @Carlson2020EmbSpe. 

## Quantification of ecological uniqueness

WeÂ used the method from @Legendre2013BetDiv to quantify compositional uniqueness
from overall beta diversity for both observed and predicted data. First, we
assembled the presence-absence data by site to form two site-by-species
community matrices, one from observed data, called $Y$ (39 091 sites by 62
species), and one from predicted data, called $\hat Y$ (99 609 sites by 62
species). We measured species richness per site as the sum of each row, i.e. the
number of species present. We removed the sites without any species from the
predicted community matrix $\hat Y$, for a new total of 92 117 sites (this was
not necessary for the observed community matrix $Y$, as it was, by design, only
composed of sites with at least one species present) and applied the Hellinger
transformation to both matrices, as recommended by @Legendre2013BetDiv for
presence-absence data. We then measured total beta diversity as the variance of
the community matrices and calculated the local contributions to beta diversity
(LCBD), which quantify how much a specific site (a row in each matrix)
contributes to the overall variance in the community [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. High
LCBD values indicate a unique community composition, while low values indicate a
more common species set. Measuring beta diversity as the variance of the
community matrices offers a critical advantage in terms of computations in this
case, as alternative approaches based on site pairwise dissimilarity would
require a much higher number of computations given the high number of sites in
our study. We note that our LCBD values, which add up to 1 by definition, were
very low given the high number of sites in both $Y$ and $\hat Y$. However, the
relative difference between the scores matters more than the absolute value to
differentiate their uniqueness. Therefore, we decided to report the LCBD values
relative to the maximum value from each matrix Y, meaning that the new maximum
value was 1, and all other values represented fractions.

## Investigation of regional and scaling variation

We recalculated LCBD values on various subregions at different locations and
scales to investigate possible regional and scaling effects. First, we selected
two subregions of equivalent size (20 longitude degrees by 10 latitude degrees)
with two contrasting richness profiles to verify if the relationship between
species richness and LCBD values was similar. We selected a Northeast subregion,
mostly species-rich, and a Southwest subregion, mostly species-poor (for both
observed and predicted data). The coordinates of both subregions are shown on
@fig:subareas. Second, we recalculated the LCBD indices at three different
scales, starting with a focus on the Northeast subregion and progressively
extending the extent to encompass the Southwest subregion (@fig:scaling). These
are conceptually similar to the spatial windows of @Barton2013SpaSca, which
allow to study the variation of beta diversity according to spatial extent. We
did these two verifications with both the observed and predicted data but only
illustrate the results with the predicted data as both were qualitatively
similar.

# Results

## Species distribution models generate relevant community predictions

The species distribution models generated richness and uniqueness results that
matched those from observed data, comforting their potential to fill-in gaps in
poorly sampled regions ([@fig:maps]). Species richness from observation data
([@fig:maps]a) was higher on the East coast and lower on the West coast, with
many unsampled patches in the North, Midwest, and Southwest. Richness results
from SDM data ([@fig:maps]b) filled in most of the gaps while still displaying
higher richness on the East coast, as well as sites with few or no species up
North and in the Midwest. There was no clear latitudinal gradient in richness,
but rather an East-West one, with landmarks such as the Rockies and croplands in
the Midwest, which should be species-poor habitats, notably visible on the maps,
separating the East and West. The SDM predictions highlighted similar results
regarding the LCBD sites, providing relevant measures to fill in gaps. LCBD
scores were low on the East Coast, and higher on the border of sampled sites in
the Midwest, as well as in North and in the South where sites with observations
were more sparse ([@fig:maps]c). Results from SDM predictions were similar,
with lower LCBD values in the East, and more unique sites in the Midwest region
and Central Mexico, as well as in some Northern regions ([@fig:maps]d).
There was no clear latitudinal gradient once again and the East-West contrast,
while present, was less clear than on the richness maps.

We measured species richness after converting the occurrence data from eBird (a) and the SDM predictions from our single-species BART models (b) to a presence-absence format per species. We applied the Hellinger transformation to the presence-absence data, then calculated the LCBD values from the variance of the community matrices.

## Uniqueness displays regional variation as two distinct profiles

The relationship between LCBD values and species richness displayed two
contrasting profiles in species-rich and species-poor regions ([@fig:subareas]).
In the species-rich Northeastern region of our study extent (North America),
LCBD scores displayed a decreasing relationship with species richness. Hence,
the sites with the highest LCBD values, i.e. the unique ones in terms of species
composition, were the species-poor sites, while the species-rich sites displayed
lower LCBD scores. Therefore, our results show that the only way for a site to
stand out and "be exceptional" in such a region is to have few species. Since
most sites in the Northeastern region comprised between 20 to 30 warblers
species, the richest ones with 40 species do not stand out and are not as
exceptional as the ones with 10 species or fewer. The Southwest subarea, on the
other hand, showed a different relationship. While the sites with the highest
LCBD values were once again the poorest ones in terms of species richness, the
decreasing relationship with richness was initially much sharper and displays a
more significant increase as richness reaches 20 species. Since most sites only
comprised around 10 species and few sites comprise more than 20, regions with 40
species stand out more and are more exceptional in such species-poor regions
than they would be in species-rich ones. Total beta diversity was also higher in
the Southwest subregion (0.436) than in the Northeast one (0.175), indicating
higher compositional differences between the sites.

The vertical and horizontal dashed lines respectively represent the median richness and LCBD value in each region.](figures/subareas-combined.png){#fig:subareas}

## Uniqueness depends on the scale on which it is measured

The LCBD-richness relationship shows some important variation when scaling up
and changing the region's study extent ([@fig:scaling]). On smaller scales,
starting with a species-rich region, the relationship is well-defined,
decreasing and curvilinear. However, as the scale increases and progressively
reaches species-poor regions, the relationship broadens, displays more variance,
and loses its clear definition while remaining generally decreasing. The
minimum relative LCBD values also increase, going from near zero to 0.3,
showing a higher contribution of the less exceptional sites to the overall
diversity on extended scales. Total beta diversity was higher when increasing
the spatial extent, going from 0.116 to 0.682. Gamma diversity and median LCBD
values displayed similar increasing trends with subarea extent, while median
richness decreased as the extent reached the species-poor sites of the Southwest
region ([@fig:medians]).

# Discussion

Our results showed a decreasing relationship between species richness and LCBD
values on broad continuous scales, but also highlight that the exact form of
this relationship varies depending on the region and the spatial extent on which
it is measured. Our species-rich Northeast subregion ([@fig:subareas]) showed a
decreasing relationship, very similar to previous studies, and slightly
curvilinear, as described by @Heino2017ExpSpe. This result for Warblers species
is in line with the original study on fish communities [@Legendre2013BetDiv] and
with following ones on insect metacommunities [@daSilva2014LocReg;
@Heino2017UnrCor; @Heino2017ExpSpe], dung beetles [@daSilva2018DisCor;
@daSilva2020CanTax], aquatic beetles [@Heino2019KniPat], stream
macroinvertebrates [@Sor2018UniSam], stream diatoms [@Vilmi2017EcoUni],
multi-trophic pelagic food webs (phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish)
[@Taranu2020LarMul], temperate forest trees [@Tan2019UndPro], mammals
(medium-to-large, small, volant) [@daSilva2020CanTax], wetland birds
[@deDeus2020AviBet], and a few other phylogenetic groups (plants, lizards,
mites, anurans, mesoinvertebrates) [@Landeiro2018SpeLow]. The slightly
curvilinear form was also in different studies [@Heino2017ExpSpe;
@Tan2019UndPro]. However, it was originally argued that the negative
relationship was not general or obligatory [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. Different
LCBD-richness relationships have also been observed, with both positive and
negative relationships for different sites or taxonomic groups in some studies
[@Kong2017SpaVar; @Teittinen2017LocGeo], as well as a negative relationship with
the number of common species but a positive relationship with the number of rare
species [@Qiao2015BetDiv]. This led @daSilva2018DisCor to say that the
proportion of rare and common species in the communities seems to determine if
the relationship will be negative, non-significant, or positive. Our results
further show that the relationship may depend on the richness profile of the
region, as the relationship was different in our species-poor Southwest
subregion, with a sharper initial decrease in contribution for medium-rich sites
and a higher contribution for highly rich ones.

The regional variation in the relationship between species richness and LCBD
scores shows that the LCBD method may identify unique sites based on different
characteristics depending on the region on which it is used. Comparative studies
have previously found a significative relationship between presence-absence LCBD
values and richness, but not between abundance LCBD values and richness
[@daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017ExpSpe]. In a presence-absence context, in
contrast with one based on abundance and count data, our results tend to confirm
that species richness is probably the most important element to determine the
LCBD value. In a species-rich region, such as our Northeast one (median richness
of 23), the only way to stand out is to have few species. On the other hand, in
a species-poor region, sites with higher richness can also be unique, yet still
less than the sites with the lowest richness. In other words, the method
identifies the poorest sites as the most unique in both species-rich and
species-poor regions, while only identifying rich sites as unique in the
species-poor region. Extremely-rich sites could in theory have high LCBD values,
but such sites may be unlikely given ecological constraints and species niche
preferences. It is unlikely that all species present in a region would cohabit
in a single site given their different niche requirements. However, on
presence-absence data, the number of species present at a site is the only way
to introduce variance (while on abundance data the variation could come from the
species counts). Therefore, the curvilinear form may depend on how big the
contrast will be between the region's median richness and its richest
ecologically possible sites.

The variation in the LCBD-richness relationship when scaling up and changing the
the overall study extent shows that the uniqueness patterns highlighted are not
necessarily the same depending on the scale on which it used. At broad spatial
scales, the uniqueness profiles from the subregions will merge, but can create a
new profile with a lot more variation. When too many poor sites are present,
rich sites will almost certainly have lower LCBD values. This shows that
aggregating too many different sites can possibly mask some patterns of
uniqueness. @Allen2019LonEff showed that bird biodiversity was indeed dependent
on scale, as gamma diversity decreased with land-use change at regional scales,
but beta diversity increased at landscape scales. @Tan2017HowBet showed that
both total beta diversity and its causes are dependent on scales, as beta
diversity decreases with increasing scales, and that environmental filtering has
greater effect at bigger grain size, such as ours.

Our results show that SDM models provide uniqueness predictions similar to the
occurrence data while filling in gaps in poorly sampled regions. This is of
interest as it provides a quantitative evaluation, however imperfect, for sites
where we would otherwise not have anything. Our SDMs also offered relevant LCBD
predictions using eBird, arguably one the largest presence-absence dataset
available (when using its complete checklists system), showed the measure's
potential on such massive data. Moreover, our results show that relevant
community-level predictions can be achieved using simple stacked-SDMs. These two
elements open up new opportunities for LCBD analyses on extended spatial scales,
as well as for the diversity of taxons on which it can be applied. At the coarse
spatial scale we used, there is also evidence of a spatial smoothing effect
caused by the SDMs: New-England and the Northeast United States shows more
uniform richness and uniqueness values on the SDM data than on the observed one.
Given that we used a very coarse spatial scales, this shows that SDMs may
overcome some large scale bias in the occurrence data, notably around cities. It
also shows that the LCBD method has more potential to highlight unique regions
more than unique sites on extended continuous scales, or at least highlight
regional rather than site differences. This is in contrast to @Heino2017UnrCor,
who found no spatial effect regarding LCBD or richness, although this was in a
totally different context -- insect communities in discrete urban ponds, whereas
our models on continuous with mobile species intend to capture dispersal between
sites -- but in line with @daSilva2018DisCor, who showed that LCBD distributions
were spatially structured across sampling sites. @Landeiro2018SpeLow showed that
uniqueness is more associated with environmental conditions than with spatial
positioning, which would concord with our results given that our SDMs only used
environmental data. Our results do not exactly concord with those of
@Heino2019KniPat, as LCBD scores did not increase with latitude, but rather
increased in an East-West gradient. Uniqueness at high latitudes is a
consequence of environmental filtering [@Tolonen2018EcoUni], but with our even
broader scale it is possible that we cover both high latitude and central
desertic regions, which may be more unique if they hold a few specialist
species, or few suitable and reachable habitat patches given the coarse
resolution we used  Overall, these distribution results have implications in
terms of conservation, which will be discussed later in light of our regional
and scaling results. (Ideally there should be something meaningful on birds beta
diversity somewhere here, probably from @Melo2009EnvDri, which shows higher BD
in mountainous areas and shows some maps of BD for all Americas which somewhat
concord to ours)

(There should be something on the implication of our findings for conservation
here. Some studies have argued that species-rich and highly-unique sites are
both relevant, yet different targets for conservation, notably
@Dubois2020EcoUni and @Yao2021EcoUni with LCBD, and @Socolar2016HowSho with beta
diversity)

(There should be a conclusion here)
