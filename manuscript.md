# Introduction

Beta diversity, defined as the variation in species composition among sites in a
geographic region of interest [@Legendre2005AnaBet], is an essential measure to
describe the organization of biodiversity in space. Total beta diversity within
a community can be partitioned into local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD)
[@Legendre2013BetDiv], which allows identifying sites with exceptional species
composition, hence unique biodiversity. Such a method, focusing on specific
sites, is useful for both community ecology and conservation biology, as it
highlights areas that are most important for their research or conservation
values. However, the use of LCBD indices is currently limited in two ways.
First, LBCD indices are typically used on local or regional scales with
relatively few sites, for example on fish communities at intervals along a river
stream [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. Second, LCBD calculation methods require complete
information on community composition, such as a community composition matrix
$Y$; thus, they are inappropriate for partially sampled sites, let alone for
unsampled ones. Accordingly, the method is of limited use to identify areas with
exceptional biodiversity in regions with poor and sparse sampling. However,
predictive approaches are increasingly common given the recent development of
computational methods, which often generate novel ecological insights from
existing data [@Poisot2019DatSyn], including in unsampled or lesser-known
locations, as well as larger spatial scales. Here, we examine whether the LCBD
method can assess ecological uniqueness on broad and continuous scales based on
predictions of species distributions and evaluate whether this brings novel
ecological insights regarding the identification of exceptional biodiversity
areas.

Species distribution models (SDMs) [@Guisan2005PreSpe] can bring a new
perspective to LCBD studies by filling in gaps and performing analyses on much
broader scales.  In a community matrix $Y$, such as required for LCBD
calculation, ecological communities are abstracted as assemblages of species
present at different sites. Viewing communities as such opens the perspective of
predicting community composition from predictions of individual species, which
is precisely the aim of SDMs. Community-level modelling from SDMs is not an
especially novel idea [@Ferrier2002ExtSta; @Ferrier2006SpaMod], but it is
increasingly relevant with the advent of large-scale, massive, and open data
sources on species occurrences, often contributed by citizens, such as eBird and
GBIF. At their core, SDMs aim to predict the distribution of a species based on
information about where the species was previously reported, matched with
environmental data at those locations, and then make predictions at other
(unsampled) locations based on their respective environmental conditions.
However, going from single-species SDMs to a whole community is not a trivial
task, and many alternatives have been suggested, such as stacked species
distribution models (S-SDMs) [@Ferrier2006SpaMod], spatially explicit species
assemblage modelling (SESAM) [@Guisan2011SesNew], joint species distribution
models (JSDMs) [@Pollock2014UndCoo], and hierarchical modelling of species
communities (HMSC) [@Ovaskainen2017HowMak]. These alternative methods have all
have different strengths, but even S-SDMs, in a sense the most simple and less
community-specific method, have been shown to provide reliable community
predictions [@Norberg2019ComEva; @Zurell2020TesSpe]. This is important, as in
the context of large-scale studies with a high number of sites and species,
reducing the model complexity with a simpler yet efficient model as an S-SDM can
be critical in terms of required computations. Regardless of the method used,
community-level analyses can be applied to the resulting community prediction,
but this has been lacking for community measures other than species richness
[@Ferrier2006SpaMod]. Notably, the LCBD framework has, to our knowledge, never
been applied to SDM results. 

However, applying local contributions to beta diversity on SDM predictions
raises the issue of calculating the uniqueness scores on much larger community
matrices. The total number of sites will increase because of (i) the continuous
scale of the predictions, as there will be more sites in the region of interest
than with sampled sites only, and (ii)  because of the larger spatial extent
allowed by SDM predictions. A high number of sites with a large extent opens up
the possibility of capturing a lot of variability of habitatsÂ­ and community
composition, but also many very similar ones, which could change the way that
exceptional sites contribute to the overall variance in the large-scale
community. LCBD scores have typically been used on local or regional scales with
relatively few sites [@Legendre2013BetDiv; @daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017UnrCor;
@Heino2017ExpSpe]. Some studies did use the measure over broader, near
continental extents [@Yang2015ComSim; @Poisot2017HosPar; @Taranu2020LarMul], but
the total number of sites in these studies was relatively low. Recent studies
also investigated LCBD and beta diversity on sites distributed in grids or as
pixels of environmental raster layers, hence continuous scales, but these did
not cover large extents and a high number of sites [@Tan2017HowBet;
@Tan2019UndPro; @DAntraccoli2020MorSpe]. @Niskanen2017DriHig predicted LCBD
values of plant communities (and three other diversity measures) on a continuous
scale and a high number of sites (> 25 000) using Boosted Regression Trees
(BRTs). However, they modelled the diversity measures directly instead of
modelling species distributions first, as we suggest here. They obtained lower
predictive accuracy for LCBD than for their other diversity measures, mentioning
that it highlighted the challenge of predicting LCBD specifically. They also
used a finer resolution (1 km x 1 km) on a regional scale, not a continental
one. Therefore, the distribution of LCBD values on broad, continuous scales with
a high number of sites and predicted species assemblages remains to be
investigated.

Measuring ecological uniqueness from LCBD indices on extended continuous scales
also raises the question of which sites will be identified as exceptional and
for what reason. The method intends that sites should stand out and receive a
high LCBD score whenever they display an exceptional community composition, be
it a unique assemblage of species or a richer or poorer community than most in
the region [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. However, both the original study and later
empirical ones have shown a decreasing relationship between LCBD scores and
species richness [@Legendre2013BetDiv; @daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017UnrCor;
@Heino2017ExpSpe]. In other words, the method tends to identify the poorest
sites as the most exceptional ones. However, this negative relationship remains
to be tested on broad continuous scales. Total beta diversity increases with
spatial extent [@Barton2013SpaSca] and is strongly dependent on scale, notably
because of higher environmental heterogeneity and sampling of different local
species pool [@Heino2015ComAna], which could potentially add some variation to
the relationship. Neither the previous studies on broad scales
[@Poisot2017HosPar; @Taranu2020LarMul; @Yang2015ComSim], on continuous ones
[@Tan2019UndPro; @DAntraccoli2020MorSpe], or on a high number of sites
[@Niskanen2017DriHig] have specifically measured the variations of the
richness-LCBD relationship according to different regions and spatial extents.
These studies all brought forward relevant elements which now need to be
combined.

This study shows that species distribution modelling offers relevant LCBD and
community-level predictions on broad spatial scales, similar to those obtained
from occurrence data and providing uniqueness assessments in poorly sampled
regions. Our results further highlight a changing relationship between site
richness and LCBD values depending on (i) the region on which it is used, as
species-poor and species-rich regions display different uniqueness profiles; and
on (ii) the scale at which it is applied, as increasing the spatial extent can
merge the uniqueness profiles of contrasting subregions to create a new,
distinct one at a broader scale. Hence, our method could prove useful to
identify beta diversity hotspots in unsampled locations on large spatial scales,
which could be important targets for conservation purposes.

# Methods

We measured how compositional uniqueness varies on broad continuous scales. We
first predicted species composition on continuous scales using extended
occurrence data from eBird and species distribution models. We then quantified
compositional uniqueness for both predicted and observed data and compared the
relationship between uniqueness and richness for different regions and scales.
We used _Julia v1.5.3_ [@Bezanson2017JulFre] for most of the project and _R
v4.0.2_ [@RCoreTeam2020RLan] for some specific steps. All the scripts used for
the analyses are available at
<https://github.com/gabrieldansereau/betadiversity-hotspots>.

## Occurrence data

We used occurrence data from eBird [@Sullivan2009EbiCit] downloaded through the
eBird Basic Dataset from June 2019 [@eBirdBasicDataset2019VerEbd]. We restricted
our analyses to the Warblers family (_Parulidae_) in North America (Canada,
United States, Mexico) using the _R_ package `auk` [@Strimas-Mackey2018AukEbi].
eBird is a semi-structured citizen science data set, meaning that observations
are reported as checklists of species detected in an observation run
[@Johnston2020AnaGui]. Observers can explicitly specify that their checklist
contains all species they could detect and identify during a sampling event, in
which case it is labelled as a "complete checklist." Using complete checklists
instead of regular checklists allows inferring non-detections in locations where
detection efforts did occur, which offers performance gains in species
distribution models [@Johnston2020AnaGui]. Therefore, we selected the data from
the complete checklists only. Our final data set comprised 62 Warblers species
and nearly 23 million observations from 9 million checklists. Warblers are a
diverse group with a sufficient number of species, are popular among birders
given their charismatic aspect, are distributed in diverse areas, and are
present relatively everywhere in North America.

We then converted the occurrence data to a presence-absence format compatible
with community analyses. We considered every pixel from our ten arc-minutes
environmental layers as a site. We then verified, for each species, if there was
a single observation in every site. We recorded the outcome as a binary value:
present (1) if a species was ever recorded in a site and absent (0) if it was
not. Complete checklists ensure that these are non-detections, rather than the
species not being reported; hence we considered them as absence data, similar to
@Johnston2020AnaGui.

## Environmental data

Our environmental data consisted of climatic data from WorldClim 2.1
[@Fick2017Wor2N] and land cover data from the Copernicus Global Land Service
[@Buchhorn2019CopGlo]. The WorldClim data consists of spatially interpolated
monthly climate data for global land areas. We downloaded the data at a
resolution of 10 arc-minutes (around 18 kmÂ² at the equator), the coarsest
resolution available, using the _Julia_ package `SimpleSDMLayers.jl`
[@Dansereau2021SimJl]. The coarse resolution should mitigate potential
imprecisions in the eBird data regarding the extent of the sampled areas in each
observation checklist. Moreover, some studies have argued that coarser
resolutions lead to less overestimation of species richness and better
identification of bird biodiversity hotspots given the patchiness of observation
data [@Hurlbert2007SpeRic]. We used the standard _bioClim_ variables, which
represent annual trends, ranges, and extremes of temperature and precipitation,
but selected only 8 out of the 19 ones to avoid redundancy (bio1, bio2, bio5,
bio6, bio12, bio13, bio14, bio15). The Copernicus data is a set of variables
representing ten land cover classes (e.g. crops, trees, urban areas) and
measured as a percentage of land cover. The data is only available at a finer
resolution of 100m, which we downloaded directly from the website. We coarsened
it to the same ten arc-minutes resolution as the WorldClim data by averaging the
pixels' cover fraction values with `GDAL` [@GDAL/OGRcontributors2021GdaOgr]. We
first selected the ten land cover variables but later removed two (moss and
snow) from our predictive models. Their cover fraction was 0% on all sites with
Warblers observations; hence they did not provide any predictive value to our
SDM models.

## Species distribution models

We predicted species distribution on continuous scales from our presence-absence
data using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BARTs) [@Chipman2010BarBay], a
classification and regression trees method recently suggested for species
distribution modelling [@Carlson2020EmbSpe]. BARTs are sum-of-trees models,
conceptually similar to Boosted Regression Trees and Random Forest, but
following a Bayesian paradigm: trees are constrained as weak learners by priors
regarding structure and nodes, then fitting and inference is made through an
iterative Bayesian backfitting MCMC algorithm generating a posterior
distribution of predicted classification probabilities [@Chipman2010BarBay;
@Carlson2020EmbSpe]. We used the package `embarcadero` [@Carlson2020EmbSpe] in
_R_ to perform the BART models. We performed BARTs separately for all species
and estimated the probability of occurrence for all the sites in our region of
interest. We then converted the results to a binary outcome according to the
threshold that maximized the True Skill Statistic (TSS) for each species, as
suggested by @Carlson2020EmbSpe. 

## Quantification of ecological uniqueness

WeÂ used the method from @Legendre2013BetDiv to quantify compositional uniqueness
from overall beta diversity for both observed and predicted data. First, we
assembled the presence-absence data by site to form two site-by-species
community matrices, one from observed data, called $Y$ (39 091 sites by 62
species), and one from predicted data, called $\hat Y$ (99 609 sites by 62
species). We measured species richness per site as the sum of each row, i.e. the
number of species present. We removed the sites without any species from the
predicted community matrix $\hat Y$, for a new total of 92 117 sites (this was
not necessary for the observed community matrix $Y$, as it was, by design, only
composed of sites with at least one species present). We applied the Hellinger
transformation to both matrices, as recommended by @Legendre2013BetDiv for
presence-absence data. We then measured total beta diversity as the variance of
the community matrices and calculated the local contributions to beta diversity
(LCBD), which quantify how much a specific site (a row in each matrix)
contributes to the overall variance in the community [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. High
LCBD values indicate a unique community composition, while low values indicate a
more common species set. Measuring beta diversity as the variance of the
community matrices offers a critical advantage in computations in this case, as
alternative approaches based on sites' pairwise dissimilarity would require a
much higher number of calculations given the high number of sites in our study.
We note that our LCBD values, which add up to 1 by definition, were very low
given the high number of sites in both $Y$ and $\hat Y$. However, the relative
difference between the scores matters more than the absolute value to
differentiate their uniqueness. Therefore, we decided to report the LCBD values
relative to the respective maximum value from each set, meaning that the new
maximum value was 1 and all other values represented fractions of it.

## Investigation of regional and scaling variation

We recalculated LCBD values on various subregions at different locations and
scales to investigate possible regional and scaling effects. First, we selected
two subregions of equivalent size (20 longitude degrees by 10 latitude degrees)
with two contrasting richness profiles to verify if the relationship between
species richness and LCBD values was similar. We selected a Northeast subregion,
mostly species-rich, and a Southwest subregion, mostly species-poor (for both
observed and predicted data). @Fig:subareas shows the coordinates of both
subregions. Second, we recalculated the LCBD indices at three different scales,
starting with a focus on the Northeast subregion and progressively extending the
extent to encompass the Southwest subregion ([@fig:scaling]). These are
conceptually similar to the spatial windows of @Barton2013SpaSca, which allow
studying the variation of beta diversity according to spatial extent. We did
these two verifications with both the observed and predicted data but only
illustrate the results with the predicted data as both were qualitatively
similar.

# Results

## Species distribution models generate relevant community predictions

The species distribution models generated richness and uniqueness results that
matched those from observed data, comforting their potential to fill in gaps in
poorly sampled regions ([@fig:maps]). Species richness from observation data
([@fig:maps]a) was higher on the East coast and lower on the West coast, with
many unsampled patches in the North, Midwest, and Southwest. Richness results
from SDM data ([@fig:maps]b) filled in most of the gaps while still displaying
higher richness on the East coast and sites with few or no species up North and
in the Midwest. There was no clear latitudinal gradient in richness, but rather
an East-West one. Landmarks such as the Rockies and croplands in the Midwest
(which should be species-poor habitats) were notably visible on the maps,
separating the East and West. LCBD scores from observation data ([@fig:maps]c)
were low on the East Coast and higher on the border of sampled sites in the
Midwest. They were also higher in the North and in the South ([@fig:maps]d),
where observations were more sparse. Results from SDM predictions were similar,
with lower LCBD values in the East and more unique sites in the Midwest region,
Central Mexico, and some Northern regions. There was no clear latitudinal
gradient once again and the East-West contrast, while present, was less clear
than on the richness maps. Absolute LCBD values (before scaling to the maximum
value observed) ranged between 1.444e-5 and 5.860e-5 for observation data and
between 5.788e-6 and 1.706e-5 for SDM data.

## Uniqueness displays regional variation as two distinct profiles

The relationship between LCBD values and species richness displayed two
contrasting profiles in species-rich and species-poor regions ([@fig:subareas]).
In the species-rich Northeastern region of our study extent (North America),
LCBD scores displayed a decreasing relationship with species richness. Hence,
the sites with the highest LCBD values, i.e. the unique ones in terms of species
composition, were the species-poor sites, while the species-rich sites displayed
lower LCBD scores. Therefore, our results show that the only way for a site to
stand out and "be exceptional" in such a region is to have few species. Since
most sites in the Northeastern region comprise 20 to 30 warblers species, the
richest ones with 40 species do not stand out and are not as exceptional as
those with 10 species or fewer. The Southwest subarea, on the other hand, showed
a different relationship. While the sites with the highest LCBD values were once
again the poorest ones in terms of species richness, the decreasing relationship
with richness was initially much sharper and displayed a more significant
increase as richness reaches 20 species. Since most sites comprised around 10
species and few ones more than 20, sites with 40 species stand out more and are
more exceptional in such species-poor regions than they would be in species-rich
ones. Total beta diversity was also higher in the Southwest subregion (0.436)
than in the Northeast one (0.175), indicating higher compositional differences
between the sites. Absolute LCBD values (before scaling to the maximum value
observed) ranged between 6.994e-5 and 1.319e-3 for the Northeast subregion and
between 6.106e-5 and 5.240e-4 for the Southwest one.

## Uniqueness depends on the scale on which it is measured

The LCBD-richness relationship showed some important variation when scaling up
and changing the region's study extent ([@fig:scaling]). On smaller scales,
starting with a species-rich region, the relationship is well-defined,
decreasing, and curvilinear. However, as the scale increases and progressively
reaches species-poor regions, the relationship broadens, displays more variance,
and loses its clear definition while keeping a decreasing form. The minimum
relative LCBD values also increase, going from near zero to 0.3, showing a
higher contribution of the less exceptional sites to the overall diversity on
extended scales. Total beta diversity was higher when increasing the spatial
extent, going from 0.116 to 0.682. Absolute LCBD values (before scaling to the
maximum value observed) ranged between  2.243e-4 and 5.276e-3 at the finest
scale, between 2.176e-5 and 3.813e-4 at the intermediate one, and between
1.180e-5 and 5.220e-5 at the broadest one. Gamma diversity and median LCBD
values displayed similar increasing trends with subarea extent, while median
richness decreased as the extent reached the Southwest region's species-poor
sites ([@fig:medians]).

Absolute LCBD values (before scaling) ranged between  2.243e-4 and 5.276e-3 at the finest scale, between 2.176e-5 and 3.813e-4 at the intermediate one, and between 1.180e-5 and 5.220e-5 at the broadest one.

The range of subarea extent showed here is the same as in @fig:scaling.](figures/subareas-medians.png){#fig:medians}

# Discussion

Our results showed a decreasing relationship between species richness and LCBD
values on broad continuous scales but also highlighted that the exact form of
this relationship varies depending on the region and the spatial extent on which
it is measured. Our species-rich Northeast subregion ([@fig:subareas]) showed a
decreasing relationship, very similar to previous studies, and slightly
curvilinear, as described by @Heino2017ExpSpe. This result for Warblers species
is in line with the original study on fish communities [@Legendre2013BetDiv] and
with following ones on insect metacommunities [@daSilva2014LocReg;
@Heino2017UnrCor; @Heino2017ExpSpe], dung beetles [@daSilva2018DisCor;
@daSilva2020CanTax], aquatic beetles [@Heino2019KniPat], stream
macroinvertebrates [@Sor2018UniSam], stream diatoms [@Vilmi2017EcoUni],
multi-trophic pelagic food webs (phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish)
[@Taranu2020LarMul], temperate forest trees [@Tan2019UndPro], mammals
(medium-to-large, small, volant) [@daSilva2020CanTax], wetland birds
[@deDeus2020AviBet], and a few other phylogenetic groups (plants, lizards,
mites, anurans, mesoinvertebrates) [@Landeiro2018SpeLow]. The slightly
curvilinear form was also found in different studies [@Heino2017ExpSpe;
@Tan2019UndPro]. However, it was originally argued that the negative
relationship was not general or obligatory [@Legendre2013BetDiv]. Different
LCBD-richness relationships have also been observed, with both positive and
negative relationships for different sites or taxonomic groups in some studies
[@Kong2017SpaVar; @Teittinen2017LocGeo], as well as a negative relationship with
the number of common species but a positive relationship with the number of rare
species [@Qiao2015BetDiv]. This led @daSilva2018DisCor to say that the
proportion of rare and common species in the communities seems to determine if
the relationship will be negative, non-significant, or positive. Our results
further show that the relationship may depend on the region's richness profile,
as the relationship was different in our species-poor Southwest subregion, with
a sharper initial decrease in contribution for medium-rich sites and a higher
contribution for highly rich ones.

The regional variation in the relationship between species richness and LCBD
scores shows that the LCBD method may identify unique sites based on different
characteristics depending on the region for which it is used. Comparative
studies have previously found a significant relationship between
presence-absence LCBD values and richness, but not between abundance LCBD values
and richness [@daSilva2014LocReg; @Heino2017ExpSpe]. In a presence-absence
context, our results tend to confirm that species richness is probably the most
important element to determine the LCBD value. In a species-rich region, such as
our Northeast one (median richness of 23), the only way to stand out is to have
few species. On the other hand, in a species-poor region, sites with higher
richness can also be unique, yet still less than the sites with the lowest
richness. In other words, the method identifies the poorest sites as the most
unique in both species-rich and species-poor regions while only identifying rich
sites as unique in the species-poor region. Extremely-rich sites could, in
theory, have high LCBD values, but such sites may be rare given ecological
constraints and species niche preferences. It is unlikely that all species
present at the regional level would cohabit in a single site given their
different niche requirements. However, on presence-absence data, the number of
species present is the only way to introduce variance (while on abundance data,
the variation could come from the species counts). Therefore, the curvilinear
form may depend on how big the contrast will be between the region's median
richness and its richest ecologically possible sites.

The variation in the LCBD-richness relationship when scaling up and changing the
overall study extent shows that the uniqueness patterns highlighted are not
necessarily the same depending on the scale on which it is used. The subregions'
uniqueness profiles will merge at broad spatial scales, but this can create a
new profile with a lot more variation. When too many poor sites are present,
rich sites will almost certainly have lower LCBD values. Aggregating too many
different sites might then possibly mask some patterns of uniqueness. Total beta
diversity, on the other hand, showed the variation expected from previous
studies, increasing with spatial extent ([@fig:scaling; @fig:medians])
[@Barton2013SpaSca; @Heino2015ComAna]. Its value was high at the continental
scale (0.628) but lower than what has been observed in some studies (e.g. 0.80
in @Sor2018UniSam). Median LCBD values and gamma diversity showed a similar
increasing trend but median richness (alpha diversity) showed a decreasing one.
This highlights that total beta diversity and LCBD values can increase even if
alpha diversity decreases. 

Our results show that SDM models provide uniqueness predictions similar to the
occurrence data while filling in gaps in poorly sampled regions. This is of
interest as it allows for a quantitative evaluation, however imperfect, for
sites where we would otherwise not have anything. Our SDMs also offered relevant
LCBD predictions using eBird, arguably one the largest presence-absence dataset
available (when using its complete checklists system), and showed the measure's
potential on such massive data. Moreover, our results showed that relevant
community-level predictions could be achieved using simple stacked-SDMs. These
two elements open up new opportunities for LCBD analyses on extended spatial
scales, as well as for the diversity of taxons on which it can be applied. At
the coarse spatial scale we used, there is also evidence of a spatial smoothing
effect caused by the SDMs: New-England and the Northeast United States show more
uniform richness and uniqueness values on the SDM data than on the observed one.
Given that we used a very coarse spatial scale, this shows that SDMs may
overcome some large-scale bias in the occurrence data, notably around cities. It
also shows that the LCBD method can highlight unique regions more than unique
sites on extended continuous scales or highlight regional rather than site
differences. This is in contrast to @Heino2017UnrCor, who found no spatial
effect regarding LCBD or richness, although this was in a totally different
context -- insect communities in discrete urban ponds, whereas our models on
continuous scales with mobile species intend to capture dispersal between sites
-- but in line with @daSilva2018DisCor, who showed that LCBD distributions were
spatially structured across sampling sites. @Landeiro2018SpeLow showed that
uniqueness is more associated with environmental conditions than with spatial
positioning, which would concord with our results given that our SDMs only used
environmental data. Our results do not concord exactly with those of
@Heino2019KniPat, as LCBD scores did not increase with latitude but rather
increased in an East-West gradient. Overall, these distribution results have
implications for conservation, as they confirm that species richness and
ecological uniqueness measured from LCBD values may conflict and highlight
different potential hotspots [@Dubois2020EcoUni; @Yao2021EcoUni], thus
reinstating the need to protect both with complementary strategies.

This study's results highlight important aspects regarding how ecological
uniqueness can be measured on broad continuous scales. First, the negative
relationship often observed between species richness and local contributions to
beta diversity (LCBD) can take different forms depending on the richness profile
of the regions on which it is measured. Therefore, species-rich and species-poor
regions may allow different ways to be unique. Second, the negative relationship
is not constant when varying the spatial extent and is much less clearly defined
on broad scales due to the contrasting regional relationships. Finally, species
distribution models (SDMs) offer a promising way to generate uniqueness
predictions on broad and continuous scales that match observation data while
providing new information for poorly or unsampled locations.
